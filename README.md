# 4chan-Text-Analysis
A text-analysis of 4chanâ€™spolitically incorrectboard /pol/

Abstract: 
Online forums like 4chan become increasingly more prominent in shaping the opinion of especially young people. 
This paper investigates the topics discussed on 4chan's anonymous board /pol/, and how the debate evolves over time. 
To address this question, we collect over 150,000 posts from /pol/ and perform a text analysis using topic modelling and a Neural Network Language Model.
The topics we identify can be labelled as anti-Semitism, racism, race, women, America, politics, history and war, Youtube and gaming as well as small hateful comments and a big \textit{other} category. 
Our Neural Network Language Model successfully groups words by semantic similarities. 
The model reveals a vast use of discriminating language on /pol/.
